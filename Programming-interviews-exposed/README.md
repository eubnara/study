  - IF you get stuck, start reading the solution.


## 1.3. Develop marketable skills

  - taking university or professional development courses or participating in **programming contests**
  - Get certified
  - keep learning
  - Note that one of the best ways to develop marketable skills is to accomplish something, whether it's in your current job, something you did as a side project, or something you worked on as an intern or for a class project.
    - Being able to talk intelligently and confidently about a project for which you played a primary role in its sucess is incredibly important.
    - Make sure you can describe the problem clearly and succinctly and how your project solved the problem, even to a nontechnical person.
    - Displaying a passion for programming is always positive and one way to make yourself stand out from the other candidates.

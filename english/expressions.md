   - 이를 코딩에도 대입해보면, 문법서를 보는 것이 도움은 되지만, 상황에 닥쳐서 API 를 보면서 헤쳐나가는 편이 빠르게 습득할 수도 있다.


 - learning vs. acquisition
 - 이해하지 못하면 아무짝에도 쓸모없다. 못알아들었으면 효과가 없다.
   - 아는 게 아니고 이해!
   - 이해가 acquisition 에서 중요하다.
   - 어떻게 말했는지가 아니라 무엇을 얘기했는지가 중요.
   - 말했던걸 알아내려고 하는게 언어습득의 키
   - **comprehensible input** -> comprehensible output
   - language acquisition 노력을 안해도 된다.
   - 언어습득은 involuntary
   - talking is not practicing
